# traveling-salesman-approximation
Input:
- number $1\le N\le1000$, which indicates the amount of points in the graph
- real $(x_{i},y_{i})$ representing the points, $i=1,...,N$, $x_{i},y_{i}\in[0,10^{6}]$

Output:
- $N$ line output where the $i$-th line contains the index of the $i$-th point visites

Note: the input shall represent a complete graph and the distance between any 2 points is computed as the euclidean distance.

## Usage
Using the Makefile you can simply run
```
make run
```

The program now promts you for the input as specified. After supllying the input, the program will show you the output as specified
